										<p>Smishing is a very simple but profitable form of phishing conducted
										via SMS. A usual scenario describes receiving an SMS from an unknown
										girl inviting you for a date. The SMS will also have a link to her
										photos in a social media profile but to see them you'll first
										need to sign in with your credentials. Of course, the link is
										thoroughly phished. Another popular smishing scenario is the
										&ldquo;problem with your banking account or credit card.&rdquo; In this
										case, the link goes to a phished bank page.</p>

										<p>Although smishing scenarios can vary, the pattern is always the same:
										luring users into clicking a link where they are asked to input their
										credentials.</p>
										<p class="p-add">Additional attack options inlcude:</p>

										<ul>
											<li>Premium SMS: Replying to the message subscribes the victim to

											<li>App installation: Depending on the OS version &amp; type, the

														<h4>Cybercriminals Using SMS Phishing Attack to Rob Cardless ATM</h4>
														<p>Cybercriminals have devised a new way of hacking cardless ATMs using 
														SMS-based phishing attacks.</p>
														<p>It has become a new trend with many financial institutions to offer
														cardless ATM transactions, thereby allowing customers to withdraw cash
														using only their mobile phones. This definitely makes things easier for
														the customer, but it does make things easy for cybercriminals too. They
														add a new number to the customers’ accounts leveraging account credentials
														that they had stolen through phishing and then use that added device to
														rob customers of their money from the cardless ATMs.</p>

														<img class="imghead" src="./static/img/020/realexamples/1.jpg">

														<p>Brian Krebs, in a post in his very popular website KrebsOnSecurity,
														writes, “Thieves are combining SMS-based phishing attacks with new
														“cardless” ATMs to rapidly convert phished bank account credentials into
														cash. Recent arrests in Ohio shed light on how this scam works.”</p>
														<p>He adds, “In May 2018, Cincinnati, Ohio-based financial institution
														Fifth Third Bank began hearing complaints from customers who were receiving
														text messages on their phones that claimed to be from the bank, warning 
														recipients that their accounts had been locked…The text messages contained
														a link to unlock their accounts and led customers to a Web site that
														mimicked the legitimate Fifth Third site. That phishing site prompted
														visitors to enter their account credentials — including usernames,
														passwords, one-time passcodes and PIN numbers — to unlock their accounts.”</p>
														<p>In this incident, cybercriminals stole credentials of around 125 Fifth
														Third Bank customers, mostly in or around Cincinnati area and then used this
														stolen data to withdraw $68,000, in less than two weeks, from 17 cashless
														ATMs in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. The court documents also show that the
														hack and ATM robbing incidents continued through October 2018 and the hackers
														got away with an additional $40,000 until four men suspected of perpetrating
														the crime were arrested.</p>
														<p>Krebs also recollects another incident that happened in January 2017-
														“In January 2017, KrebsOnSecurity told the story of a California woman who
														saw nearly $3,000 drained from her account via a cardless ATM operated by
														Chase Bank. In that incident, the thieves didn’t even need to know her ATM
														PIN; the thieves were able to use a phone number and mobile device they
														controlled and associate it with her Chase account simply by supplying her
														username and password.”</p>
														<p>He notes, “As the January 2017 story illustrates, cardless ATM scams aren’t
														new, but they are becoming more prevalent as more banks turn to cardless ATM
														technology as a convenience for customers,”, and adds, “This time last year,
														cardless ATMs were offered mainly by the big banks, and then only at some of
														their ATMs. Now, many smaller regional and local banks have upgraded their
														cash machines to enable the new technology.”</p>
														<p>Cardless ATMs are of course a new trend, people are just beginning to use
														it and the majority are just beginning to hear of it. But it would soon be a
														very popular thing, which means cybercriminals too would be targeting cardless
														ATMs in many ways, in the times to come. The best thing to do, to prevent your
														money from getting stolen from cardless ATMs, is to refrain from responding to
														requests for personal or financial information via email, text messages or in
														any other way over your phone. Whenever you have a doubt about a call, email
														or message seeking information about your account, contact your bank directly
														and re-confirm things.</p>

							<div>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12">
										<img class="rimg right" src="./static/img/020/les2-phish2.png" />
										<p>OTP (One-Time-Password) is a part of two-factor authentication that
										many people use to secure their accounts. Besides the login and password,
										you need an OTP that is usually sent to you by SMS. The process looks
										super secure, but cybercriminals have invented a way to bypass this
										protection via phishing tricks.</p>

										<p>Perhaps you received an email with a link to your account that
										features two-factor authentication. You click on it, and the real
										website login page pulls up. You get the OTP and successfully log in –
										nothing looks suspicious, but don’t be so sure. True, the website you
										logged into was not a phished one, but clicking the link in the email
										redirected all your traffic to the attacker’s server. There your browser
										cookie was extracted and passed onto the attacker. Using that cookie,
										the attacker can easily impersonate you and log into your account.</p>

										<p>OTP phishing is certainly not new, that’s why it’s time to give you an
										overview of the different technical attack methods.</p>

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12">
										<img class="rimg right" src="./static/img/020/les2-phish3.png" />
										<p>Many users encounter phishing as a link in an attached file. Very often
										it’s a .pdf that contains nothing else but the malicious link. Click on it
										takes you to a phished webpage that will try to lure out your login
										credentials.</p>
										<p>Nowadays, many people are aware that a .pdf can bring about trouble.
										But what about other files, for example, .eml voice records? Can they be
										dangerous?</p>
										<p>Just imagine receiving an .eml file with a message that says, “New voice
										record received”. Of course, you want to know what is inside, so you open
										the file and land on a Microsoft login page which prompts you to enter your
										credentials. Many people find it logical as Microsoft takes care of their
										security. Unfortunately, their credentials fall right into the 
										cybercriminal’s hands.</p>
										<p>The attachment could also be an HTML file disguised as a web-form from
										your bank. In reality, it contains a script that opens a phishing page with
										a web-form in your browser. In all cases, the impact is the same – the
										cybercriminals get your credentials.</p>

										<p>What if you find in your Gmail a letter from someone you know on a
										topic you’re interested in with a .pdf attachment? Chances are, you will
										click on the attached file. Then a Google login page will open and ask
										you to input your credentials. It looks trustful, because it even has
										google.com in the address bar, though looking a bit strange, something
										like this: “data:text/html,https://accounts.google.com”.</p>
										
										<p>In reality, this is a sham. The page is phished, the .pdf is an image
										with an embedded link, and the sender’s name and discussion topic was
										picked up from a hacked machine belonging to one of your contacts. How?
										A malicious algorithm digs into the contact books of already hacked
										machines and automatically creates and sends new phishing emails with
										correspondent names and topics. That’s how the automated spear-phishing
										with machine learning (ML) works.</p>
										
										<p>Phishers use ML and AI (artificial intelligence) in many scenarios.
										It lets them extract plenty of information about users from the Internet
										space, especially social networks. Previously, an attacker had to
										personally gather information about a victim, spending a lot of time
										digging for clues. Nowadays, an algorithm can do that for a fraction of
										the time, then create and send a spear-phishing email with the gathered
										information. This automation increases the number of potential victims

								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12">
										<img class="rimg right" src="./static/img/020/les2-phish5.png" />
										<p>Have you ever used a QR code? Most everyone uses it today, but only
										a narrow circle of security experts is aware of the potential risks it
										hides. Truth is, anyone can create their own QR code in seconds –
										including cyber criminals. They can forge a QR code of some trustful
										organization with a URL leading to their malicious website. So, you
										may think you are inputting your credentials on your bank’s website
										but in reality, you are giving them away to the cybercriminals, and
										they empty your account. This attack is even harder to detect, because
										the URL address used in QR codes comes in short form so you can’t check
										where it leads before the website is downloaded.</p>
										
										<p>Another cunning attack uses QR codes to steal credentials from
										instant messengers like WhatsApp. The attackers use a malicious
										application that runs a server between the user and the WhatsApp web
										interface. The application opens a real WhatsApp page prompting the
										victim to log in via QR code. If you do that, the app intercepts your
										login data on its server and extracts it in a text file. And voila –
										the attacker can now log into your account, read your messages, and
										impersonate you in correspondence.</p>

										<p>This type of phishing might well be the oldest one – deceiving

										point is simple: scammers call you pretending to represent your
										bank and try to obtain your account and card data with cunning
										questions. Nowadays, vishing has stepped up a notch, using not only
										human scammers but bots and robots as well. This is a real technical
										leap for cybercriminals because it lets them attack a huge number of
										potential victims with almost no effort, 24/7. Today, bots can
										impersonate humans very plausibly, and this ability is skyrocketing

														<h4>CRA income tax phishing scam still going strong, police warn</h4>
														<p>Police in Ontario are still being flooded with calls after warning
														the public last month of the so-called Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
														phishing scam.</p>
														<p>Ontario Provincial Police said the scam, which is running “rampant”
														throughout the province has bogged down provincial communications
														centres with calls from the public informing officers of the scam.</p>
														<p>The CRA scams began emerging in 2013 and have since become a popular
														tool for defrauding people over the phone or by email.</p>
														<img class="imghead" src="./static/img/020/realexamples/6.jpg">
														<p>In the phone scam, someone claiming to be from the CRA calls and, in
														a conversation that starts out calmly enough, tells the potential victim
														that they have made an error on their tax return or neglected to file
														it. The phone number may seem legitimate to those with caller ID, police
														have warned. The fraudster then asks for financial or banking
														information in order to settle an alleged debt to the government.</p>
														<p>More recently, scammers have requested potential victims to pay off
														their “debt” with iTunes gift cards.</p>
														<p>“Some of our communications centres are receiving upwards to 100 or
														more calls per day from people wanting to advise that they received one
														of these scam-related calls,” Sgt. Peter Leon said in a statement. “And
														although your intentions are appreciated, it is these calls which are
														at times restricting the OPP’s ability to take calls for service from
														the public that require a police response.”</p>
														<p>CRA scams tend to get worse right before, during and immediately
														after Canadians file their tax returns each spring. Fraudsters have
														also used legitimate-looking emails, sending a notice of a tax refund
														and then asking for personal information in order to collect the
														money.</p>

										<p>There are many phishing tools that require no technical expertise to
										get them to run. On the Darknet, scammers can buy something called
										“multi-brand phishing kit” – a software that lets them create very
										plausible clones of famous online shops. This scam works in combination
										with Search Engine phishing, where the scammer simply needs to deploy a
										malicious website and advertise it to get the site in the first hits of
										search engines. To entice victims, the scammer then announces a
										“big sale” on the website with unbelievably low prices for the most
										popular goods, like fancy smartphones and laptops. (They steal pictures
										and descriptions of the goods from the legitimate online shop). To buy
										anything, the users are required to input their credit card numbers and
										other personal data and… the story gets a sad ending.</p>

										you’ve been recorded watching an adult website. Now your computer is under
										the hacker’s total control, he says, and if you won’t pay a ransom
										immediately the video will be sent to all contacts from your address
										book.</p>
										<p>In reality, this message is a bluff. No one hacked your machine. But
										then, how did the crook find out your password? It’s not an enigma. He
										took it from the stolen database of an online shop or other web resource
										where you signed up at one time. Such databases are widely sold on the

										<p>IDN stands for Internationalized Domain Name and refers to domain
										names written in languages other than English. This attack is possible
										because letters from different languages may sometimes look similar.
										For example, the Cyrillic “р” and “г” look similar to the Latin “p”
										and “r”. These letters are called homographs. Cybercriminals can
										easily spoof a website by simply using homographs in the URL. For
										example, if an attacker wants to spoof the Apple website, they can
										simply substitute the English “p” for its Russian homograph “р” in
										apple.com, thus creating a web-domain that looks absolutely the same.
										Moreover, the attacker can even legitimately get an SSL certificate
										for this site. Thus, your browser’s address bar will show
										https://www.apple.com, exactly the same as the real URL of the Apple
										website, and you will be lead to give away your credentials to the
										criminals.</p>

										<p>Cybercriminals can take over a subdomain of a legitimate company

										Amazon S3. After a while, you decide you don’t want to use the service
										anymore but don’t care about removing the DNS entry connected with the
										Amazon S3 Bucket – a feature that contains the subdomain name.
										Cybercriminals have learned to use this carelessness to their advantage.
										They register this vacant S3 bucket for themselves and use it for
										malicious purposes like phishing. But as the DNS remains linked to your
										subdomain address, one day you may be surprised to find that your
										inactive subdomain is not only alive but also serves for criminal

										<img class="rimg right" src="./static/img/020/les2-phish11.png" />
										<p>Sometimes web-applications may have security flaws that can be used for
										phishing. One example is the Open Redirect vulnerability. It allows
										attackers to add to the website URL an external link that redirects users
										to a phishing webpage. Most users will notice only the first, legitimate
										part of the URL – and have a false sense that the site is secure.</p>
										<p>XSS (Cross-Site-Scripting) is one of the most popular attacks on
										web-applications as it can be used for phishing in more than one way. For
										starters, an attacker can add a malicious JavaScript to the website URL to
										redirect users to a phishing page. Exploiting XSS, the attacker can also
										embed the phishing page right onto the website or provide content
										injections. In case of the latter, malicious data is injected into the
										legitimate content, and users think it trustworthy. This could easily be
										a web-form that asks for login credentials – which will end up in the

										<img class="rimg right" src="./static/img/020/les2-phish12.png" />
										<p>In a pharming attack, your traffic to a specific legitimate website is
										redirected to a phishing webpage. For example, you may type “google.com”
										into your browser but open a phishing website instead. How is this
										possible? For starters, this attack is not possible unless your computer
										has been infected with malware that changed the “hosts” file on your
										workstation. This malware’s function is to set wrong correspondence
										between the IP addresses and the specific domain name, thus redirecting
										the traffic.</p>
										<p>In our example, the malware has changed the real IP address of
										google.com to the IP address of the attacker’s website. Of course,
										cybercriminals can use the same technique for any domain name, including
										your bank or social media website. Being unaware that you are redirected

							<div>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-12">
										<p>Phishing and spear phishing are very common forms of attacks. The
										difference between them is primarily a matter of targeting. Phishing
										emails are sent to very large numbers of recipients, more or less at
										random, with the expectation that only a small percentage will respond.
										Spear Phishing has a few key differentiators:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Spear phishing emails are carefully designed to get a
											particular recipient to respond. The person targeted could be
											anyone in the organization, or business.</li>
											<li>Uses specific context to try to convince the target of its
											legitimacy. For example, share online that you will be
											participating in a marathon in New York soon, and you might get
											an email from a colleague saying “Hello, while you’re in New
											York you can train for your marathon with my friend Susan.
											Contact here under this link.”</li>
											<li>Adding personalized information (sender name, location, date,
											references to a friend, etc.) can make more people trust the
											email.</li>
										</ul>
