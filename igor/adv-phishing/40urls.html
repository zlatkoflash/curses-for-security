						<h2>How Links Are Formed?</h2>
						<p>
							What is the key to reading URLs in links? First, remember that within a link,
							the important part lies between the double forward-slash “//” and the first
							single slash, as shown in the example below. To interpret the URL, go to the
							first single forward slash and then back up from there. The area after the
							first forward slash contains information about directories, subdirectories,
							filenames, and file types.

								<h2>What Could A Phishing URL Look Like?</h2>
								<p>
									The attacker must intelligently choose the domain names as the goal
									is to convince users that the web address is authentic. Let’s analyze
									the phishing example below.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>

						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-12 col-tbl-whatcould">
								<div class="httpline">
									<span class="http">http://</span>

									<span class="subitem1">com-<wbr>webappsuserid<wbr>29348325<wbr>limited</span>
									<span class="white">.</span>
									<span class="domname">active-userid.com</span>
									<span class="white">&nbsp;</span>

										<span class="rtxt domname">active-userid.com</span>

									<div class="item">
										<span class="ltxt">path</span>
										<span class="rtxt path">/webapps/89980/</span>

										<span class="ltxt">Subdomain item1</span>

								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-12">
								<p>
									Although the real domain name is active-userid.com, the attacker tried
									to make the domain look like paypal.com by adding FreeURL. When users
									see paypal.com at the beginning of the URL, they may easily decide to
									trust the site and even share their sensitive information with it. This
									method is frequently used by attackers.

								<h2>Cybersquatting And Typosquatting</h2>
								<p>
									Other methods that are often used by attackers are Cybersquatting
									and Typosquatting.
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<strong>Cybersquatting</strong>
										(also known as domain squatting) involves registering, marketing, 
										or using a domain name with ill intent to profit from the goodwill 
										of a trademark belonging to someone else. Let’s say the name of your 
										company is “abcompany,” and you register your domain as abcompany.com. 
										If you neglect to purchase abcompany.net, abcompany.org, and abcompany.biz, 
										phishers can easily register them as their own and use them for fraudulent 
										purposes such as phishing. The cybersquatter may also offer to sell these 
										additional domains to you at an inflated price.
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong>Typosquatting</strong>,
										also called URL hijacking, is a form of cybersquatting which exploits typographical
										errors made by Internet users when inputting a website address into a web browser. 
										Most of these errors are hard to notice while quick reading, hence the danger. 
										URLs created by Typosquatters are almost indistinguishable from those of their respective 
										trusted domains. A user may accidentally enter an incorrect website address or click a 
										link which looks like a trusted domain and end up visiting an alternative website owned 
										by a phisher. 
									</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p class="p1">
									A famous example of Typosquatting is <strong>goggle.com</strong>,
									an extremely dangerous website. Another similar one is 
									<strong>yutube.com</strong>, which targets 
									<strong>Youtube users</strong>.
								</p>
								<p class="p2">
									Similarly, <span class="bstrong">www.airfrance.com</span> has been
									typosquatted as <span class="bstrong">www.arifrance.com</span>,
									diverting users to a website peddling discount travel. 
								</p>
								<p class="p3">
									Other examples include <strong>paywpal.com</strong>,
									<strong>microroft.com</strong>, <strong>applle.com</strong>,
									<strong>appie.com</strong>.
								</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<!-- Subdomains -->

				<div class="row row-sect--gtxt">
					<div class="col-12 col-block col-subdoms">
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-12">
								<h2>Subdomains</h2>
								<p class="p1">
									If you visit a website and notice “www1”, “www2”, or other “www#” in
									the URL, what does this mean? Simply put, very popular websites may
									have multiple servers working in a load-balancing configuration to
									serve content when requested. Therefore, the respective company may
									use this numbering strategy for clarity. Seeing a numbered server in
									a URL is not in itself an indicator of a phishing site.
								</p>
								<p class="p2">
									To help users quickly determine the top-level and secondary domains within
									a URL, many companies and organizations have started to use “domain
									highlighting.” When a user visits a site, part of the URL will dim after
									a few seconds, leaving the top-level and secondary domains dark. For example: 
								</p>
								
								<div class="info">
									<div class="info-wrap">
										<img src="./static/img/040/i-lock.png">
										<span class="green">PayPal, Inc. (US)</span>
										<span class="vdelim">|</span> <span>https://www.paypal.com/home</span>
									</div>
									<div class="reload">
										<img src="./static/img/040/i-reload.png">
									</div>
								</div>
								
								<p class="p3">
									It’s a good habit to always look for the signs that mark a website legitimate
									and secure:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>the closed padlock,</li>
									<li>https://, and</li>
									<li>
										the company name highlighted within the URL. Some browsers may also add
										the company name in green in front of the URL (as in the PayPal example above).
									</li>
								</ul>
								<p class="p4">
									If a site’s certificate is expired or otherwise invalid, some browsers, such as
									Internet Explorer and Firefox, or security services will warn users. If you
									wonder whether it is safe to proceed through the warning, use other available
									indicators (review the URL again) to help determine whether the site is
									legitimate. If in doubt, do not proceed.

				<div class="row row-sect--gtxt">
					<div class="col-12 col-block col-moreurl">
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-12">
								<h2>More URL Examples</h2>
								<p class="p1">
									Now that you’re armed with this background information, let’s look
									at some more examples.
								</p>
								<ul class="num">
									<li>
										Nowadays, people are fairly used to seeing and using commercial sites, such as: 
										<span class="bstrong">http://www.amazon.com</span>. This is a well-known site, 
										and the URL doesn’t include any suspicious modifications. 
									</li>
									<li>
										URLs can be formed in almost any fashion, allowing website owners to build unique 
										site names. Unfortunately, this also makes it easy for phishers to do the same, meaning 
										they can build site names that closely resemble legitimate and trusted websites. 
										For example, a simple period can make a lot of difference:<br>
										<span class="bstrong">http://www.ama.zon.com/<wbr>gp/cart/view.html/<wbr>ref=nav_cart</span>
										<p class="p2">
											If a person were to click on the link above, instead of going to amazon.com
											they will be directed to zon.com, which could be a site registered by phishers.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										Don’t trust links with the “@” symbol in the URL, like in this example: 
										<strong>http://</strong><span class="bstrong">amazon.com@66.161.153.155</span>/<strong>catalog</strong>
										<p class="p3">
											Clicking on the link above will direct you to the IP address 66.161.153.155,
											not to amazon.com. 
											And if you see the “@” symbol, be particularly careful as phishers routinely
											use this URL-manipulation tactic.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										What about this type of URL? 
										<strong>http://209.131.36.158/<wbr>amazon.com/<wbr>index.jsp</strong>
										<p class="p4">
											Similarly to what we saw in #3 above, this URL will direct the user
											to the specified IP address, not amazon.com which is listed after the first
											single forward slash.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										What if you see a URL similar to the one below – whether you’re asked to click it or you notice it loading in your browser: 
										<strong>http://www.google.com/<wbr>url?q=http://<wbr>www.badsite.com</strong>
										<p class="p5">
											This sample URL will refer a person from one site (in this case, google.com) 
											to another, i.e., badsite.com (note the “=http://” nomenclature which allows
											this). 
											Referrals are not in themselves bad, but a referral could lead to a phishing
											site.
											In this case, badsite.com doesn’t look to be legitimate.
