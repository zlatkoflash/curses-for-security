Hi @Zlatko Derkoski, when you will be reviewing Advanced course code, please take into account
• overall code quality and performance
Zlatko:
HTML perfect
CSS in the style for different section different CSS, global CSS should be, but, if is done like this it should continue like this.
JS is nice, Igor style, for me is clear, but If somebody tell me to edit I will. Usually the scripts should not be edited by other developer.

• if code is understandable and if there are comments explaining the logic, if variables have understandable naming convention
• modularity and re-usability
Zlatko:The code for me is clear, if need help for Igor, and the next course have simillar elements and structure I can create it.


• not so important, but still - code formatting
Once you have the code, feel free to create empty repository on github, create a branch and PR with Advanced course, and comment on the PR - I think perhaps it will be the easiest way to comment the code. Or maybe you have another smart alternative.
Zlatko: the branch is created. When you will have time, send me the email and I will share permission.



Zlatko:
top header menu on roll over no bold: underline, the first item that have dropdown no need for effect.
The tips are done with slider, i think should be space between the slides.
I am not sure from where
