Hi @Zlatko Derkoski, when you will be reviewing Advanced course code, please take into account
• overall code quality and performance
• if code is understandable and if there are comments explaining the logic, if variables have understandable naming convention
• modularity and re-usability
• not so important, but still - code formatting
Once you have the code, feel free to create empty repository on github, create a branch and PR with Advanced course, and comment on the PR - I think perhaps it will be the easiest way to comment the code. Or maybe you have another smart alternative.


top header menu on roll over no bold: underline, the first item that have dropdown no need for effect.
The tips are done with slider, i think should be space between the slides.
